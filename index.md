Hello!

I am a physicist working on the statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium and disordered systems, sometimes exploring their connection with biology and ecology. I hold a permanent researcher position at the Institut de Physique Théorique ([IPhT](https://www.ipht.fr/)) of the CEA Saclay, in the Paris area. 

Previously, I was a CV Raman Postdoctoral Fellow of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore where I collaborated with [Sriram Ramaswamy](https://physics.iisc.ac.in/~sriram/) and [Vishwesha Guttal](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/). Before that, I was a postdoc at the Technion, working with [Guy Bunin](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/bunin/) and [Yariv Kafri](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/kafri/). I completed my PhD at Université Paris Cité under the supervision of [Frédéric van Wijland](https://sites.google.com/site/fvanwijland/home). You can find the manuscript of my thesis [here](https://thibaut-arnoulxdepirey.github.io/these_arnoulxdepirey.pdf). 

For more information, please refer to my CV, available in [English](https://thibaut-arnoulxdepirey.github.io/CV_english.pdf) and [French](https://thibaut-arnoulxdepirey.github.io/CV_french.pdf), and to my [publication list](./publications.md). If you are a student, feel free to contact me to know about possible projects. 

<!-- Hi, my name’s Max! I’m a doctoral researcher at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy. If you want to know more about me, feel free to take a look at [my education](./education.md), [my employment](./employment.md), [the things I’ve written](./publications.md), [the presentations I’ve held](./presentations.md), [the events I’ve organised](./events.md), or [the courses I’ve taught](./teaching.md). There is also information regarding [my services to the profession](./services.md) as well as [the grants and honours I’ve received](./financials.md). Most of this information can also be found bundled in my CV (of which you can find the most recent PDF in English [here](https://github.com/alephmembeth/curriculum-vitae/blob/main/english/cv_english.pdf) and in German [here](https://github.com/alephmembeth/curriculum-vitae/blob/main/german/cv_german.pdf)).

# Teaching

From 2018 to 2021, I worked as a teaching assistant in the “Frontières du Vivant” bachelor program of the Université Paris Cité. The topics covered were Newtonian
mechanics, thermodynamics, geometrical optics and electronics. In the fall 2021, I was main lecturer of the Newtonian mechanics course.
